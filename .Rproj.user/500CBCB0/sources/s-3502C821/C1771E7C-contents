## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##新增/替換/刪除元素

```{r}
a <- c("1","b","TRUE")

a[[4]] <- "7" # 元素不存在： 增加
a[c(5,6)] <- c("J", "K")
a
```

```{r}
a[[7]] <- "Johnson"
a
a <- c(a , "Mary")

```
